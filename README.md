# ERC-721 Website
Initially built during ETH Denver by [@BrandonRelay](https://github.com/BrandonRelay) and [@tomhschmidt](https://github.com/tomhschmidt). Forked from  [gwei.io]() project using [Gulp.js](https://gulp.js) for automation and Bulma as its framework.

## Building the site
- Please be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed before moving forward
- Install Gulp globally: `$ npm install --global gulp-cli`
- Run `gulp` to develop locally

## Contributing
- Fork this repository
- If adding a project to the list of ERC-721 supporters, please ensure you're on mainnet and include a link to your smart contracts in the PR
- Run `gulp dist` before you push so the latest files go to `docs` so GitHub Pages sees them
